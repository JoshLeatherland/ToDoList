A straightforward and efficient to-do application that helps you organize your tasks with ease. Customize your dashboard by creating columns, adding tasks, and managing them effectively. Each task can include comments and be marked as complete. The application also displays a task count indicator for both completed and incomplete tasks in each column.

## Features

- Create custom columns for organizing tasks.
- Add comments to individual tasks for better context.
- Mark tasks as complete to track your progress.
- Task count indicators for completed and incomplete tasks per column.

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Themes:** Allow users to personalize the look and feel through the UI.
